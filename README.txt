== Boeing 737-300 ==

This is the 737-300 in Progress and under GNU GPL v3.0

The work is based on the work of David Culp (FDM) and Innis Cunningham (3d-model), then development was continued by chtadmin.

The Boeing 737-300 is now in heavy development by Soitanen.

- make correct thrust for different altitudes and speed
Medium perspective:
- work on FMC
- hydraulics system
- electrical system
Things, that I can't do due to my skill:
- new 3D cockpit. Target - PMDG level :)
